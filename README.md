# Discord Music Bot

Discord bot that plays youtube videos, made with music in focus

Inspired by Rhythm bot, but with the purpose to be used as a template to the servers create their own versions,

In this way will be very difficult to Google shut down each server's Bot

## How To Use

First you have to go the developers section of discord and create a Bot and pick the token

Second create a "config.json" file with this code
``` 
{
    "token": "your token here"
}
```

Finally run this command

Yarn<br>
```yarn start```<br>
NPM<br>
``` npm run start```

PS: pm2 must be installed to work  

Or<br>
``` node main.js```
